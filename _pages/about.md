I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at LinkedIn leading the AI Algorithms Foundation team, responsible for developing horizontal AI technologies for search and recommender systems w.r.t. Natural Language Processing, Ranking, and Personalization. Before joining LinkedIn, I was a research intern at IBM Research Almaden, and an engineering intern at LinkedIn. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) under the supervision of Dr. [Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu), with research focus on data mining and machine learning. I received my Master and Bachelor degrees from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn).
